          raised in Pasadena, California. Kelly began dancing at the age of
          three at Pasadena Civic Ballet Center where she fell in love with
          Ballet, Jazz, Tap, Hip Hop, Modern Dance and was first exposed to
          contemporary dance from her high school dance teacher Liz Adamis.
          Kelly went on to earn her BFA in Dance with a Minor in Applied
          Psychology from UC Santa Barbara. While at UCSB Kelly works by
          choreographers such as Andrea Miller, Shen Wei, Monica Bill Barnes,
          Jose Limone, Jacqulyn Buglisi, Anna Halprin, Simone Forte, Yvonne
          Rainer, Nancy Colahan, Christina Mcarthy and countless student
          choreographers.{" "}

          While at UCSB Kelly fell in love with GAGA, a movement language and
          improvisation practice created by Ohad Nahirin. Kelly then spent the
          next three summers (2016-2018) studying GAGA at workshops in SF, LA,
          and Tel Aviv. Kelly’s experiences embodying the movement language of
          GAGA as well as her improvisation and choreography classes with her
          teacher and mentor Brooke Smiley initiated Kelly’s own physical
          research on somatic based approaches to improvisation and
          choreography. She became fascinated by the physiological +
          psychological intricacies of the body/mind connection as well as the
          positive psychological effects of dancing and creating.

          Kelly developed two pieces while at UCSB, both of which researched the
          intricacies of emotional intelligence and personal growth: moodwings
          and Poetry of a Mute Soul. Her choreography is rooted in a personal
          practice of exploring the relationship between emotional processing
          and patterns of tension in the body. Kelly crafts embodied experiences
          of personal growth by combining improvisation tasks, embodied
          metephor, & specific choreography. Since graduating Kelly has
          choreographed and presented 3 independent projects titled o p e n s p
